# PokeProject

Although I am a big fan of Pokemon, I recently realized that I have never done anything with the Poke API. Therefore, I am currently trying to utilize Angular to build an application that makes use of this API. It is an exciting challenge for me as I will have the opportunity to integrate my passion for Pokemon with my programming skills, and also to learn more about Angular in the process.

This project was made using the Angular CLI.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
